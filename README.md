# Rails Tutorial Sample App

This the sample app for the rails tutorial book by Michael Hartl.

The code in this repository was not written by Alex, but by Michael Hartl.  I did type it all in manually and created all the files etc as I went through the book, but I don't want to give the impression that this is original code.  You can find (nearly) the same application at mhartl's github page, there should be few differences.

The actual app is a sort of a "baby twitter".  It allows users to create microposts and follow other users, and then displays a feed of the other users microposts as well as interfaces for showing all users, showing a users profile, and more.
